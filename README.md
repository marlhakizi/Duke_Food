# Duke_Food

Duke_Food is a two part web application system that helps Duke Dining restaurants reduce their food waste by:
* Displaying how much of each inventory ingredient was wasted via a dashboard and estimating ... This mainly targets dining managers
* Showing to students/faculty discounted dining services at specific times 
*   for restaurants connecting to their point-of-sale systems  that consisted of their inventory database (shipments for food each week)
