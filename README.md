# Duke_Food

Duke_Food is a two part web application system that helps Duke Dining restaurants reduce their food waste by:
* Displaying how much of each inventory ingredient was wasted via a dashboard and estimating the projected costs of those food wasted. This mainly targets dining managers. The dashboard is available at https://food-waste-329921.uc.r.appspot.com/
* Showing to students/faculty discounted dining services at specific times. The display for this version is in: https://github.com/mjtv128/students_food
